# wf-transcriptomes

This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow
for assembly and annotation of transcripts from Oxford Nanopore cDNA or direct RNA reads.
It has been adapted from two existing Snakemake pipelines:
* https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-nanopore-ref-isoforms
* https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-nanopore-denovo-isoforms
